## [Description](#table-of-contents)

Dynamic Dishes is a full-stack application that allows users to discover and rate recipes shared by other users, and even add their own! Users are able to add their own recipes and rate existing ones by creating an account for the application. This application is full-stack because users are able to interact with live HTML pages on the frontend while user input and account information is stored in the application's database on the backend. 

## [Installation](#table-of-contents)

Packages required: express, express-session, mysql2, sequelize, connect-session-sequelize, dotenv, and bcrypt. The application is deployed using Heroku. 

## [Usage](#table-of-contents)

When entering the app, users are presented with a landing page where they are able to browse from a list of recipes created by other users. Users can create an account or login to an existing account by clicking on the login button at the top-right corner of the page. In order to successfully login, the user must enter an email and password that was entered through the 'create account' prompt. Once logged in, the user is then redirected to the homepage, but this time with the ability to add new recipes and rate existing ones.
